                                    For many decades or even centuries, whales are fascinating the world. These intelligent giants of the ocean
                                    are no fish, but mammels. Unlike fish, whales donâ€™t have gills, so they need to get up to the surface to breath
                                    air through their blow holes into their lungs. When breathing out, their fountains can be seen even from a greater
                                    distance as they can get up to 10 meters at times.Once submerged, whales can stay under water up to 90 minutes before
                                    they fill their lungs with air again. You can never tell what might happen on one of our whale-watching tours as it
                                    can be funny, dramatic, exciting, interesting or all feelings combined.

                                        Kayaking is a fun activity that involves moving through water in a small water vessel with the aid of a double-bladed
                                        paddle. It allows the boat driver to maneuver through waterways by sitting face-forward and propelling ahead with 
                                        alternating side-to-side paddle strokes. The paddler sits in the cockpit with the legs extended beneath a closed deck,
                                        leaving the upper body free and exposed.The kayak has been around for centuries. It was first used by the Inuits in the
                                        Arctic regions for navigating waterways. It was a pragmatic way to hunt, fish, and transport passengers across the water.
                                        Its easy access and basic functionalities have made it the burgeoning recreational activity known around the world today.
